### Bug Reports

Reporting a bug? If relevant, we recommend including:

* Your OS name and version
* The versions of tools you're using (e.g. `stack`, `ghc`).
* The versions of dependencies you're using

For your convenience, we recommend pasting this script into bash and uploading the output [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/).

```
command -v sw_vers && sw_vers # OS X only
command -v uname && uname -a # Kernel version
command -v stack && stack --version
command -v stack && stack ghc -- --version
command -v stack && stack list-dependencies
command -v psql && psql --version
command -v mysql && mysql --version
command -v mongo && mongo --version
command -v sqlite3 && sqlite3 --version
```

* Also, is there anything custom or unusual about your setup? i.e. new or prerelease versions of GHC, stack, your database, etc.

* Finally, if possible, please reproduce the error in a small script; we have created [a script for each backend](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/tree/master/.github/reproductionTemplates) with a minimal setup to use for this purpose. These are made with [Stack's scripting support](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#script-interpreter) and can be run as `./file-name.hs`. Even better, writing a failing test case is tremendously helpful.

### Support

Please direct support questions to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/persistent+haskell) or the [Yesod Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yesodweb). If you don't get a response there, or you suspect there may be a bug in Persistent causing your problem, you're welcome to ask here.
